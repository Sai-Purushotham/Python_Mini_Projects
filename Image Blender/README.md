This program lets you blend two images together. Here's how it works:

You select two images using buttons in the GUI.
You type a number (alpha) between 0 and 1 into a text box.
The program combines the images based on the alpha value (e.g., if alpha is 0.7, the first image contributes 70% and the second 30%).
It shows the blended image and saves it as "Output.jpg".
